# Distributed Systems Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the Distributed Systems course. Each assignment focuses on a different aspect of distributed systems, leveraging various technologies and algorithms.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Communication using GRPC, RabbitMQ, and ZeroMQ
In this assignment, we explore different communication protocols and messaging systems:
- **GRPC**: A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.
- **RabbitMQ**: An open-source message broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
- **ZeroMQ**: A high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications.

### Assignment 2: Raft Consensus Algorithm using GRPC
This assignment involves implementing the Raft consensus algorithm using GRPC. The Raft algorithm is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand and implement. It is used to manage a replicated log.

### Assignment 3: MapReduce using GRPC
In this assignment, we implement the MapReduce programming model using GRPC. MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

## Setup and Installation
To set up and run the assignments, follow the instructions in each assignment's directory. Each assignment has its own set of dependencies and setup instructions.
